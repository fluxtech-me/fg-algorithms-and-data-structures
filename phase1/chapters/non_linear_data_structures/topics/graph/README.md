## Definition

In computer science, graph theory is the study of graphs,  
a mathematical structure used to model pair wise relations between objects from a certain collection.

In one restricted but very common sense of the term,  
a graph is an ordered pair $G = (V,E)$ comprising:

- $V$, a set of **vertices** (also called **nodes** or **points**);
- ${\displaystyle E\subseteq \{\{x,y\}\mid x,y\in V\;{\textrm {and}}\;x\neq y\}}$, a set of **edges** (also called **links** or **lines**),  
which are unordered pairs of vertices (that is, an edge is associated with two distinct vertices).

To avoid ambiguity, this type of object may be called precisely an **undirected simple graph**.
